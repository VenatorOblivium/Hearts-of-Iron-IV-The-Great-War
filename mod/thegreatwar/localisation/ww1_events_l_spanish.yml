Although recent research has focused on local and regional aspects of the Revolution, it was a genuinely national revolution. Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 35 years long regime of Porfirio Díaz to find a managed solution to the presidential succession. This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection. Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in 1910 presidential election, and following the rigged results revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potosí. Armed conflict ousted Díaz from power and a new election was held in 1911, bringing Madero to the presidency."

Faced with the refusal,The two commanders then retired to begin the battle, ordering General Gomez to open fire to prevent the advance of the Americans. At the beginning of the battle, Gómez was mortally wounded, taking the command Lieutenant Colonel Rivas; Boyd died shortly afterwards and another officer named Morey was injured; The invaders, seeing themselves without bosses, surrendered after suffering severe losses.This hard-fought battle lasted about three hours and further tightened relations between the two countries. However, the US government was more concerned about its increasingly deteriorating relations with the German government and wanted to avoid two possible fronts in case of war with Germany, decided to solve its problems with Mexico. A treaty was agreed upon in which it was felt that the punitive expedition should leave the country.This provoked a new sense of patriotism in the north of the country as there were a large number of volunteers who were quickly trained and enlisted in the Mexican army for fear of a strong counterattack by Pershing."

After months of negotiations, the second German military mission arrived in Constantinople in December 1913 under the leadership of Otto Liman von Sanders.

With signing of the secret treaty between the German and the Ottoman Empire on 2nd August 1914 it was agreed that the mission should stay in Constantinople. It was promised that the mission would get a vast influence on the conduct of war of the Ottoman army. Many German officers would hold leadership positions. Numerous officers, specialists and troops were deployed during the war. It is estimated that approximately 25,000 men were in use for the military mission. The Ottoman army was supplied with weapons and aircrafts. Since the sea was locked, material and human support could only be sent overland to the Ottoman Empire. Since the German Empire was at war with Serbia, the supply could only be sent through neutral Romania, but this was not enough.

The reserves of bread were running short, causing hunger among the urban population, where support for the Bolshevik government was strongest. In order to satisfy the minimal food needs, the Soviet government introduced a strict control over the food surpluses of the prosperous rural households. Since many peasants were extremely unhappy with this policy and tried to resist it, they were branded as 'saboteurs' of the bread monopoly of the state and advocates of the free 'predatory', 'speculative' trade. Lenin believed that prodrazvyorstka was the only possible way to procure sufficient amounts of bread and other agricultural products for the population of the cities during the war."
